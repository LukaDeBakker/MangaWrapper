# MangaWrapper

This is a personal project of mine that I will be working on.

The goal is to write a Node.JS API in conjunction with a C# API.
-> The NodeJS API will scrape my personal data from the MangaDex website and upload it into a database.
-> The C# API will take these downloaded data, categorise it into Neo4J and then display it inside an app.
